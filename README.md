## Setup Credentials for Sending a Webhook and Managing LINE Official Account

This guide outlines the steps to set up credentials for sending webhooks, configuring admin and client credentials, and managing the LINE Official Account settings.

### Prerequisites
- A LINE Developers account
- A LINE Official Account

### 1. Setting Up Webhook Credentials
To send webhooks, you need to create a channel and obtain credentials from the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/en/).

#### Steps:
1. Log in to the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/en/).
2. Create a new provider if you donâ€™t already have one.
3. Click on "Create a Messaging API Channel" and provide the required information:
   - Channel name
   - Channel description
   - Email address
   - Terms of Use agreement
4. After the channel is created, note down the following credentials:
   - **Channel ID**
   - **Channel Secret**
   - **Channel Access Token** (Generate this from the console)

### 2. Configuring Admin and Client Credentials
To set up admin and client credentials:

#### Admin Credentials:
1. In the LINE Developers Console, navigate to your channel settings.
2. Under the "Messaging API" section, configure the webhook URL:
   - Enter the webhook endpoint (e.g., `https://yourserver.com/webhook`)
   - Enable the webhook by toggling the switch to "Enabled."
3. Use the **Channel Access Token** to authenticate requests from your server.

#### Client Credentials:
1. For client-side integration (e.g., LINE Login), configure the LINE Login settings:
   - Go to "LINE Login" in your channel settings.
   - Set the callback URL (e.g., `https://yourserver.com/callback`).
   - Obtain the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for authentication.

### 3. Setting Up LINE Official Account
To customize your LINE Official Account name and policies for receiving messages, use the [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/).

#### Steps:
1. Log in to the [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/).
2. Select your account from the dashboard.
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **Account Name:** Update the name to match your branding.
